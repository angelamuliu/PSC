
Hello! This is Angela Liu.
Included here are the collection scripts, analysis scripts, and visualization files used for my project @ PSC in summer 2014.

You CANNOT just copy paste these and expect them to work with your system. They refer to resources only those inside of the PSC network can access. However, I hope that you can look at these as reference for whatever you may be trying to build!
